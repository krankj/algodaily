/*
You're given an array of strings containing alphabetical characters and certain $ characters. A $ represents a DELETE action whereby the character before it is deleted.

Each of these strings will be run through a method to operate on the $ DELETE action. We want to find out if the final string is the same for all of them. Let's take an example:

const input = ["f$st", "st"]
isDollarDeleteEqual(input);
// true
// true because both become "st"
*/

function isDollarDeleteEqual(arr) {
  return;
}

console.log(`Output: ${isDollarDeleteEqual(["f$st,st"])}`);
